\section{Methodology}

Many existing climatologies of Rossby wave activity focus on zonally propagating waves, whereby the wave identification method simply applies Fourier analysis along adjacent lines of constant latitude \citep[e.g.][]{Glatt2014}. More sophisticated methods have been developed for tracking non-zonal, synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets \citep[e.g.][]{Zimin2006,Souders2014}, however such sophistication was not needed in devising a method for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. Instead, it was possible to make use of the fact that the pattern traces an approximate great circle path \citep{Hoskins1981}. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (itself a great circle path) traces the approximate path of the PSA pattern, the identification algorithm developed here could simply apply Fourier analysis along the equator in the new zonal direction. Such grid rotation is commonly used in ocean modelling to avoid coordinate singularities caused by the convergence of meridians at the poles \citep[i.e. the grid is rotated to place its North Pole over a continent; e.g.][]{Bonaventura2012}, but it has not previously been applied in the context of wave identification in the mid-to-upper troposphere.

\subsection{Identification algorithm}\label{s:psa_id}

\subsubsection{Grid rotation}

In order to align the new equator with the approximate path of the PSA pattern, a global 0.75$^{\circ}$ latitude by 0.75$^{\circ}$ longitude grid was defined (i.e. the same resolution as the original ERA-Interim data) with the north pole located at 20$^{\circ}$N, 260$^{\circ}$E. The 500 hPa zonal and meridional wind data were used to calculate the meridional wind relative to the new north, and then the temporal anomaly of this new meridional wind was linearly interpolated to the rotated grid for use in the Fourier analysis (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:rotation}). It should be noted that zonal wave studies (e.g. Chapter \ref{c:zw_climatology}) tend to skip this final step of calculating the anomaly, because in the case of zonal waves the temporal mean of the meridional wind is typically close to zero (and hence waveforms defined by the meridional wind already oscillate about zero). 

On this rotated grid, the search region of interest was defined as the area bounded by 10$^{\circ}$S to 10$^{\circ}$N and 115$^{\circ}$E to 235$^{\circ}$E (this approximate area is referred to as the PSA sector at times throughout the thesis). This region was selected via visual comparison with existing definitions of the PSA pattern (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:eof}), however the final results were not sensitive to small changes in pole location or search region bounds.

The solid green box is bounded by 10$^{\circ}$S to 10$^{\circ}$N and 115$^{\circ}$E to 235$^{\circ}$E on the rotated grid and corresponds to the search region of interest (or `PSA sector'), while the green dashed line corresponds to the equator on the rotated grid.%

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fourier analysis}

To prepare the meridional wind anomaly for Fourier analysis, the meridional mean was calculated over 10$^{\circ}$S to 10$^{\circ}$N (in order to eliminate the latitudinal dimension) and then values outside of 115$^{\circ}$E to 235$^{\circ}$E were set to zero. Zero padding is a commonly used technique in signal processing when the waveform of interest does not complete an integer number of cycles in a given domain, and is equivalent to multiplying the original signal (in this case the meridional mean meridional wind anomaly) by a square window function. This multiplication (or convolution) of two waves has consequences in frequency space, such that even a perfectly sinusoidal signal that would repeat exactly six times (for example) over the zero padded domain would show power at more than one frequency. This phenomenon is known as spectral leakage (into the side lobes of the frequency spectrum) and arises due to the fact that a square window function is not square in frequency space. In analyses where excessive leakage is undesirable, a Hanning or Hamming window can be used instead. In the frequency space these windows do not display as much spread into the side lobes, however this comes at the expense of the magnitude of the main lobes. Since the selection process used here (see below) focuses identifying the main lobes, a square window function was considered most appropriate.

\subsubsection{Identification and characterisation of PSA-like variability}

Given that the PSA pattern completes approximately 1.6 to 2.0 cycles (depending on the specific EOF mode) over the 120$^{\circ}$ search area (see Figure \ref{fig:eof}), data times where a Fourier transform revealed wavenumber 5 and 6 as dominant frequencies over the zero padded 360$^{\circ}$ domain was the focus of this analysis. In particular, a data time was said to display PSA-like variability (and hence was selected for further analysis) if the amplitude of the wavenumber 5 and 6 components of the Fourier transform were ranked in the top three of all frequencies. The vague `PSA-like' descriptor is used because a number of features besides the PSA pattern (e.g. Antarctic Dipole, Amundsen Sea Low, zonal wave three pattern) can exhibit wavenumber 5--6 variability in the PSA sector.

Once these data times were selected, additional information from the Fourier transform was used to characterise the phase and amplitude of the PSA-like variability. With respect to the former, it can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:transform} that within the search area the phase of the wavenumber 5 and 6 components of the transform (and usually also adjacent frequencies like wavenumber 4 and 7) tend to align both with each other and also with the phase of the actual signal. The phase of the wavenumber 6 component of the Fourier transform was therefore used as a proxy for the phase of the signal as a whole, and this information was used to separate data times displaying the actual PSA pattern from the larger population of PSA-like variability (note that similar results were obtained using wavenumber 5). The details of this separation process (e.g. the phase ranges used to define the PSA pattern) are discussed below. In order to quantify the amplitude of PSA-like variability, the wave envelope construct defined in Section \ref{s:envelope} was used. Since the envelope of the complete signal (i.e. with all wavenumbers retained) can be quite noisy, the amplitude of PSA-like variability was defined as the maximum value of the envelope when only wavenumbers 4 to 7 are retained (see Figure \ref{fig:transform} for an example envelope).

\subsubsection{Timescale considerations}

In applying the identification algorithm to the ERA-Interim dataset, this analysis focuses on monthly timescale (i.e. 30 day running mean) data at 500 hPa. As with the zonal wave analysis, this atmospheric level was selected as it represents a mid-to-upper tropospheric level that is below the tropopause in all seasons and at all latitudes of interest. Given the equivalent barotropic nature of the PSA pattern (i.e. the wave amplitude increases with height but phase lines tend to be vertical) the results do not differ substantially for other levels of the troposphere. 

To explore the implications of this timescale selection, the Fourier transform used in the identification process was applied to the 500 hPa rotated meridional wind anomaly data (Figure \ref{fig:periodogram}). That analysis revealed wavenumber 7 as the most dominant frequency for daily timescale data in the PSA sector, with wavenumber 6 dominating the frequency spectrum for a 10--90 day running window. Given that the PSA pattern is itself characterised by wavenumber 5-6 variability in the PSA sector, this result suggests that (a) the PSA pattern is a dominant regional feature on weekly through to seasonal timescales, and (b) by extension the climatological results obtained from 30 day running mean data may also be relevant at those timescales.

\section{Results}

\subsection{General PSA-like variability}

Before attempting to isolate the PSA pattern using the phase information obtained from the identification algorithm, it is worth considering the characteristics of all PSA-like variability. In total, 55\% (7163 of 13120) of data times were identified as displaying PSA-like variability (i.e. wavenumber 5 and 6 were among the top three ranked frequencies), which is consistent with the fact that wavenumber 6 dominates the Fourier spectrum at the monthly timescale (Figure \ref{fig:periodogram}). Grouping consecutive identifications into discrete events revealed a mean event duration of 19.7 data times, with a distribution depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lifecycle}a. While interpretation of these duration data is complicated by the 30 day running mean applied to the original data (e.g. an event that lasted 10 data times could be said to span anywhere between 10 and 40 days) and the occurrence of short events immediately before or after a long event (i.e. they could conceivably be considered as a single event), it is clear that PSA-like variability often persists for up to a few months at a time.     

Building on this baseline duration data, the life cycle of events lasting longer than 10 data times was investigated in more detail. As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lifecycle}b, the amplitude of these events tended to peak mid-event with some longer-lasting events peaking more than once during their lifetime (perhaps suggesting that some events simply merge into the next). The mean ($\pm$ standard deviation) linear phase trend across all events lasting longer than 10 data times was $0.12 \pm 0.38^{\circ}$E per data time, which indicates that while there was a tendency for events to propagate to the east, a substantial proportion moved very little during their lifetime. Important insights were also obtained by considering the phase distribution across all individual PSA-like data times (Figure \ref{fig:phase_distribution}). On an annual basis the distribution is clearly bimodal, with the two maxima of the kernel density estimate located at 12.75$^{\circ}$E and 45.0$^{\circ}$E. Since the phase was defined as the location of the first local maxima of the wavenumber 6 component of the Fourier transform, this approximate 30$^{\circ}$ phase separation indicates a pair of spatial patterns that are exactly out of phase (Figure \ref{fig:sf_composites}). Taken together these patterns clearly represent the single most dominant mode of variability in the PSA sector, and also closely resemble the PSA-1 mode identified by previous authors. Unlike the spatial patterns associated with the local minima (Figure \ref{fig:sf_composites}), the spatial streamfunction anomalies associated with these maxima are of similar magnitude, which suggests that the underlying data times tended to display a coordinated wave pattern as opposed to an individual anomaly of wavenumber 5--6 scale. On the basis of this finding, it appears that filtering the PSA-like data times according to the location of the two local maxima represents a simple and valid technique for isolating the PSA pattern from the larger population of PSA-like variability.

\subsection{The PSA pattern}\label{s:psa_results}

In defining the PSA pattern according to the peaks of the PSA-like phase distribution, it was necessary to account for seasonal variations in the location of those peaks (Figure \ref{fig:phase_distribution}). A spread of 15$^{\circ}$ was considered sufficient to capture these variations and hence the 15$^{\circ}$ interval about each local maxima containing the highest mean values (taken from the annual kernel density estimate) was determined. This approach was used to account of the fact that the phase histograms were not symmetrical about the local maxima and it yielded two intervals corresponding to the positive (4.5 to 19.5$^{\circ}$E) and negative (37.5 to 52.5$^{\circ}$E) phase of the PSA pattern. Both intervals represented approximately 15\% of all data times (14.8\% for the positive phase versus 15.8\% for the negative), which suggests that the two phases have a similar frequency of occurrence. With this definition in place, it was possible to investigate variability and trends in the PSA pattern as well as its influence on surface temperature, precipitation and sea ice. 

\subsubsection{Trends and variability}

During autumn and winter in particular, the middle years of the study period (1991--2002) were characterised by a predominance of positive PSA pattern activity, while negative phase activity was more common in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:phase_distribution}). This variability is reflected in the linear trends observed over 1979--2014, with negative phase activity showing a statistically significant increasing trend (at the $p < 0.05$ level) on an annual basis and smaller non-significant increasing trends for summer, autumn and winter (Figure \ref{fig:psa-neg_seasonality}). Positive phase activity showed a non-significant decreasing trend on an annual basis and also during autumn and winter, with an increasing trend observed for summer (Figure \ref{fig:psa-pos_seasonality}). Consistent with previous studies, both phases of the PSA pattern were most active during winter and spring (Figure \ref{fig:psa-neg_seasonality} and \ref{fig:psa-pos_seasonality}).

To account for the fact that not all months have an equal number of days, the counts for each month are presented as a percentage of the total number of days for that month. Years in panel (a) are defined from December to November (e.g. the `year' 1980 spans December 1979 to November 1980) and trends that are statistically significant at the $p < 0.10$ and $p < 0.05$ level are indicated with a circle and star respectively.%

In attempting to explain annual and decadal variability in PSA pattern activity, previous authors have suggested that coupling between the SAM and ENSO is important \citep[e.g.][]{Fogt2006}. While some degree of coupling is evident in Figure \ref{fig:sam_v_enso} (i.e. the positive phase of the PSA pattern was most common when positive ENSO events and negative SAM events coincided), it is clear that the SAM has a much stronger association with PSA pattern activity than ENSO. Recent positive trends in the SAM during summer, autumn and to a lesser extent winter \citep[the latter being smaller and not statistically significant; e.g.][]{Simmonds2015} are also broadly consistent with the negative trends observed in the PSA pattern during those seasons.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Influence on surface variables} 

In order to assess the influence of the PSA pattern on regional climate variability, the composite mean surface air temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly and sea ice concentration anomaly was calculated for both the positive and negative phase (Figure \ref{fig:surface_composites}). On the western flank of the central composite mean streamfunction anomaly associated with positive phase activity, anomalously warm conditions were evident over the Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea and interior of West Antarctica, particularly during autumn and winter. The northerly flow responsible for those warm conditions also induced large precipitation increases along the West Antarctic coastline and reduced sea ice in the Amundsen Sea. On the eastern flank, anomalously cool conditions were evident over the Antarctic Peninsula, Patagonia and the Weddell Sea during all seasons (winter and spring especially), with the latter also experiencing large increases in sea ice. Anomalously dry conditions were also seen over the Antarctic Peninsula in association with the weaker westerly flow. 

The anomalies associated with the negative phase of the PSA pattern were essentially the reverse of the positive phase (Figure \ref{fig:surface_composites}). It is also noteworthy that while the hemispheric composite mean streamfunction anomaly associated with the PSA pattern gives the impression of a hemispheric ZW3 pattern, the phase of that pattern and the unremarkable anomalies either side of the Indian Ocean anomaly are inconsistent with the characteristics of the dominant ZW3 mode (Chapter \ref{c:zw_climatology}).

\section{Discussion}

A novel method has been presented for objectively identifying the PSA pattern. By rotating the global coordinate system such that the equator (a great circle path) traces the approximate path of the PSA pattern, the method was able to utilise Fourier analysis to quantify the phase and amplitude of wave-like variability in the PSA sector. The climatology produced from the application of this method revealed that the PSA pattern often persists for months at a time. There was an almost equal split between events that propagate (to the east) and those that remain relatively stationary, and the pattern is most active during winter and spring. The pattern has a strong influence on temperature and precipitation variability over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, and on sea ice variability in the adjacent Amundsen, Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. 

In reconciling the results of the Fourier analysis with existing EOF-based definitions of the PSA pattern, a strong resemblance was found between the existing PSA-1 mode and the spatial pattern corresponding to the bimodal phase peaks of wavenumber 5--6 dominant variability in the PSA sector. The lack of a higher-order, multi-modal phase distribution may explain the degenerate nature of the existing PSA-2 mode (and the difficulty that researchers have had in identifying a tropical driver of that mode). It would appear that together, the degenerate EOF-2 / EOF-3 pair (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:eof}) may simply represent the remaining wavenumber 5--6 variability in the PSA sector, which likely comprises of contributions from the ZW3 as well as isolated Amundsen Sea Low and Antarctic Dipole variability.    

By using the bimodal phase peaks as a means to define PSA pattern activity, it was possible to identify a trend towards the negative phase of the pattern over the period 1979--2014 on an annual basis and also during summer, autumn and winter. This autumn trend (and the high latitude temperature and sea ice anomalies associated with the negative phase of the PSA pattern) is consistent with the work of \citet{Ding2013}, who found that autumn warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and associated sea ice declines over the Bellingshausen Sea are associated with an atmospheric circulation resembling the negative phase of the PSA pattern. While this explanation makes sense on the eastern flank of the central circulation anomaly associated with that pattern, the negative phase of the PSA pattern is also associated with strong cooling over West Antarctica. Autumn temperature declines have not been observed in that region, and thus the results presented here suggest that the PSA-related cooling must have been offset by other factors. 

In contrast to the autumn warming over the Antarctic Peninsula, winter warming over West Antarctica has been associated with an atmospheric circulation resembling the positive phase of the PSA pattern \citep{Ding2011}. The climatology presented here revealed a (albeit non-significant) trend towards the negative phase of the PSA pattern during winter, which raises the question: how is it that winter temperature trends over West Antarctica are associated with an atmospheric circulation resembling the positive phase of the PSA pattern, but a climatology of PSA pattern activity does not reveal trends consistent with that finding? One possible answer to this question comes from \citet{Li2015a}. They analysed Rossby wave trains associated with observed SST trends in the tropical Atlantic, tropical Indian, west Pacific and east Pacific regions and found that all four have a centre of action over the Amundsen Sea. While none of these individual wave trains resembled the PSA pattern, a linear combination of the four of them did (with the tropical Atlantic and west Pacific identified as most influential). In other words, the integrated influence of tropical SST trends on the atmospheric circulation resembles the positive phase of the PSA pattern, but the waves underpinning that teleconnection do not. This result is consistent with earlier studies that identified the tropical Atlantic as a driver of recent trends in West Antarctica \citep{Li2014,Simpkins2014}. Another possible answer comes from \citet{Fogt2015}, who suggest that radiative forcing has played a role in Amundsen Sea Low trends that are consistent with warming in West Antarctica. 

This idea that wave trains from the tropical Atlantic and/or radiatively forced Amundsen Sea Low variability might be responsible for a teleconnection resembling the PSA pattern (i.e. as opposed to changes in actual PSA pattern activity) goes to the heart of the reversibility argument made in Section \ref{s:psa_overview}. For a proposed teleconnection to be robust, it must be evident when looking through the lens of both the variable and mechanism of interest. However, even if these alternative explanations do reconcile the discrepancy between the climatology presented here and winter warming over West Antarctica, the associated circulation anomaly would bring cooler conditions and wind-driven increases in sea ice along the western Antarctic Peninsula, contrary to the observed warming and sea ice declines \citep{Clem2015}. One possible explanation is that the negative autumn sea ice anomalies persist into winter \citep{Ding2013}, however it is clear that there is still work to be done to fully understand recent temperature and sea ice changes in the region.

One topic not addressed by the climatology presented here is variability in the east/west location of the PSA pattern. In response to the emergence of central Pacific ENSO events in recent years \citep[e.g.][]{Ashok2007}, some authors have suggested that the PSA pattern moves east/west depending on the precise location of the associated tropical SST anomalies \citep[e.g.][]{Sun2013,WilsonBromwich2014,Ciasto2015}. Others suggest that the pattern is relatively stationary \citep[e.g.][]{Liu2007,Ding2012}, however either way the broad region (10$^{\circ}$N to 10$^{\circ}$S in the rotated coordinate system) used by the identification algorithm developed in this chatper renders it insensitive to subtle east/west movements. Given that the PSA pattern did not show a strong association with the Ni\~{n}o 3.4 index (an index that is sensitive to both central and eastern Pacific ENSO events), it would be fair to say that even if the location of tropical SSTs does cause the pattern to move slightly, this would represent only a small fraction of all PSA pattern activity. 

This weak association with ENSO challenges our fundamental understanding of the PSA pattern. The most commonly held view to date is that the pattern is primarily a response to ENSO forcing \citep[e.g.][]{Mo2001} that is moderated by the state of the `atmospheric bridge' \citep{Liu2007}. In particular, the pattern is thought to be most active when ENSO and the SAM are in phase \citep{Fogt2006}. A more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the pattern and tropical convection would be required to confirm this (e.g. lagged correlations with SSTs and other indicators of tropical convection like the outgoing longwave radiation), but the results presented here suggest that the PSA pattern might be better conceptualised as a preferred regional atmospheric response to various internal and external forcings (i.e. with ENSO being just one of many players). Rather than casting the SAM in a facilitating/bridging role, the strong association identified here is more consistent with the work of \citet{Ding2012}, who suggest that the SAM (i.e. the leading EOF mode of SH circulation variability) represents the superposition of the PSA pattern in the Pacific sector and a (largely independent) meridional dipole pattern in the Indian Ocean sector. In other words, an explanation for the close relationship between the SAM and PSA pattern might be that they are essentially one and the same phenomenon in the Pacific sector. In contrast to \citet{Ding2012} the results presented here downplay the association between the SAM / PSA pattern and ENSO, however in an analysis of seasonal timescale data they do note that the PSA pattern appears to be a preferred mode that is very sensitive small variations in tropical convection. Tropical SST forcing is one way to force such variations, but it is not a requirement. The complex nature of the relationship between tropical SSTs, convection and the PSA pattern is something that was explored by \citet{Harangozo2004} and certainly warrants more attention.
