In addition to a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the PSA pattern, tropical convection and the SAM, our new methodology could also be adapted for use in future studies of other quasi-stationary waveforms. The most obvious candidate is the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern \citep{Wallace1981}, which plays an important role in winter climate variability over the North Pacific and North America \citep[e.g.][]{Notaro2006}. Like its namesake, the PNA pattern follows an approximate great circle path, has traditionally been analysed via EOF analysis and has been implicated in recent mid-to-high latitude trends \citep[e.g.][]{Ding2014,Liu2015}. Other non-zonal waveforms that do not follow an approximate great circle path would be more challenging, however methods have been developed for applying Fourier analysis to synoptic-scale, non-zonal waveforms \citep{Zimin2006,Souders2014} and may represent a starting point for future research.
