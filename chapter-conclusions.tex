\section{New approaches to wave identification}

The first major contribution of the thesis is the new approaches it presents for the identification and characterisation of long-lived, quasi-stationary waveforms. By adapting data analysis techniques from related fields of research (i.e. the wave envelope construct used in identifying synoptic-scale Rossby wave packets and a grid rotation method commonly used in ocean modelling) these approaches fully exploit the capabilities of Fourier analysis, thus allowing a more complete description of the waveform characteristics (e.g. wave phase and amplitude). A limitation is the occurrence of false positives (e.g. the identification algorithm might designate a data time as displaying PSA-like variability when in fact only a single anomaly of wavenumber six-scale was observed), however the false positive rate was likely lower than for existing grid point or EOF-based approaches (e.g. Section \ref{s:zw_spatial_characteristics}).

While the most obvious future application for these new approaches is subsequent studies of SH zonal wave activity and the PSA pattern, they could also be adapted for use in studies of other quasi-stationary waveforms. The most obvious candidate is the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern \citep{Wallace1981}, which plays an important role in winter climate variability over the North Pacific and North America \citep[e.g.][]{Notaro2006}. Like its namesake, the PNA pattern follows an approximate great circle path, has traditionally been analysed via EOF analysis and has been implicated in recent mid-to-high latitude trends \citep[e.g.][]{Ding2014,Liu2015}. Other non-zonal waveforms that do not follow an approximate great circle path would be more challenging, however methods have been developed for applying Fourier analysis to synoptic-scale, non-zonal waveforms \citep{Zimin2006,Souders2014} and may represent a starting point for further research. 

%Teng2012 suggest that there is a NH ZW3, however the approach we used might not be appropriate because it doesn't dominate the spectrum


\section{New insights into the zonally asymmetric features of the SH circulation}

Application of the new wave identification approaches revealed that while ZW1 and ZW3 are both prominent features of the climatological circulation, the defining feature of highly meridional hemispheric states is an enhancement of the ZW3 component. It also confirmed the existence of the PSA-1 mode described by previous authors, but questioned the physical reality of the PSA-2 mode. Only a weak relationship was found between the PSA pattern and ENSO, suggesting that the pattern might be better conceptualised as a preferred regional atmospheric response to various external (and internal) forcings. 

These insights into the fundamental characteristics of the zonally asymmetric circulation highlight a number of areas for further research. Given that the PSA pattern is widely regarded as the primary mechanism by which ENSO influences the high southern latitudes, our understanding of the relationship between the pattern and tropical convection may need to be revisited. The forcing of the zonal waves is also an area that warrants further attention. While they are thought to owe their existence to the configuration of the land masses and significant topography of the SH \citep{Baines1989}, little is known about the drivers of zonal wave variability. The results presented here suggest that ZW3 variability would be a particularly important focus of this future work.  

The documented influence of the zonally asymmetric circulation on surface temperature, precipitation and sea ice variability (Chapter REF) provides a strong case for this future research into the associated forcing factors. Given that the identified seasonal trends towards the negative phase of the PSA pattern were not consistent with recent warming observed over the West Antarctica (and were only partially consistent with warming over Antarctic Peninsula), future research is also still needed to fully reconcile the role of the atmosphere in recent high latitude trends. 

Future research concerning the zonal waves and PSA pattern would also act to confirm 
One reason why 


Limitations: Short time period, data sparse high southern lats
Limitations: Trends in reanalysis data are particularly problematic. As are observations of the actual trends.


\section{A practical solution to the reproducibility crisis}

In an attempt to address this deficiency, this essay describes a procedure for reporting computational results that was employed in a recent \textit{Journal of Climate} paper. The procedure was developed to be consistent with recommended computational best practices and seeks to minimise the time burden on authors, which has been identified as the most important barrier to publishing code. It should provide a starting point for weather and climate scientists looking to publish reproducible research, and it is proposed that journals could adopt the procedure as a minimum standard.

Future work: Lobby AMS, comprehensibility (which is also a limitation), culture change
