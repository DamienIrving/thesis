	I would like to acknowledge and thank my supervisor, Professor Ian Simmonds. During my candidature I spent a substantial amount of time volunteering as an instructor with Software Carpentry and as the National Secretary of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. At one stage I even took a month off to work for CSIRO on an exciting new initiative called the Climate and Weather Science Laboratory. I found these activities to be a much needed distraction from the daily PhD grind and they have contributed greatly to my development as an early career scientist. Ian was always very supportive of these extra-curricular activities and I am very grateful that I was able to have a complete PhD experience, rather than just a narrow one focused solely on my research project. The research we conducted and the reproducible manner in which it was presented is highly innovative, and I think that has a lot to do with the freedom I had to explore new ideas and learning opportunities.
